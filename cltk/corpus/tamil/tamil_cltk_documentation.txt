Tamil
****

Tamil is the oldest of Dravidian languages. Along with Chinese, Greek, Sanskrit and others, it is one of the world's classical languages. 
Tamil literature spans 3500 years. This language was the first to develop a distinct prose form of writing among the classical languages 
of the world. Tamil is the only language among the old languages that has a history of 2000 or more years of existance. With slight variation 
in scripts and usage, the language still thrives. The literatures written in 200 BC are still learnt and used in normal speeches. The Tamil 
Thirukkural is second only to the Bible in number of published translations. Over the course of the language's development, many words from 
other languages have been absorbed. For instance, Tamil spoken in Tamil Nadu has a significant number of words from Sanskrit, English, Dutch, 
French and Urdu.
